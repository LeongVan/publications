## *[2021] Understanding the Evaluation Abilities of External Cluster Validity Indices to Internal Ones*
This paper tackles the problem of evaluating the effectiveness of internal Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Existing methods, including NC-based and external CVI-based approaches, often fail under various data scenarios. To address this, the authors propose a novel method named CAMER (CVI Ability MEasurement via Ranking consistency), which quantitatively measures the evaluation ability of external CVIs through rank consistency metrics like Kendall’s Tau and Spearman's Footrule.

**Key contributions:**

Introduced the CAMER framework to quantitatively assess how well external CVIs evaluate internal CVIs.

Explored seven widely-used external CVIs across six synthetic datasets with diverse characteristics (e.g., spherical, noisy, skewed).

Validated the results on four real-world datasets to confirm the robustness of CAMER.

Summarized external CVIs’ evaluation strengths under different scenarios, providing a practical guideline for selecting evaluation metrics.
